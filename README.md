## A. Project Objective
The primary focus of this project is the tracking and interpretation of our robot’s motor
encoders to provide an estimate of the robot’s location in a global reference frame.

### 1.1	Encoder Scripts from Lecture Notes:
This projects consists of the following code files
    * encodercontrol01.py – 04.py

### 1.2	Traverse a Straight Line:

### 1.3	Track Encoder Counts for the reverse( ), pivotleft( ), and pivotright( ) Functions:


## C. Dependancies

+ Ensure the following depenancies are installed
    ```
    pip install xxx
    ```

## D. Running the Program

+ Run the programs individually to check the outputs.

    ```
    python3 xxxxx.py
    ```
## E. Results
+ The following output files will be generated - Nodes, NodesInfo and nodePath.
